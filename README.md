## Description
As an avid reader, I love tracking what I’m reading and what I hope to read next. Part of the fun is seeing how long it takes me to finish a book, but most reading apps—especially the most popular one, Goodreads—feel outdated. I wanted a single place where I could track everything: how much I’ve spent on books this month, my progress on a ‘100 Classics’ list, and more. But beyond just tracking, I envision this app growing into a space where readers can connect—sharing recommendations, discussing their latest reads, and building a true book-loving community.

## <a name="author"></a>About The Author
Books have always been a passion of mine, transporting me to far-off fantasy worlds for countless hours. I love what they mean to me, and it’s exciting to see more people falling in love with reading. Many avid readers create their own tracking systems using Notion, Excel, or bullet journaling, but I want to simplify that process. My goal is to develop an app that combines the best features of existing platforms with a more intuitive and modern user interface—making it easier than ever for book lovers to track and organize their reading journey

Whether I’m diving into code or exploring new ideas, I’m driven by a love for innovation and the joy of creating experiences that others can enjoy.
